# iD - friendly JavaScript editor for [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/)

This code is a port of the iD javascript editor to node.js
the idea is that we can test and develop it on the command line to help improve code quality.

iD is available under the [WTFPL](http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/), though obviously, if you want to dual-license
any contributions that's cool. It includes [d3js](http://d3js.org/), which BSD-licensed.
